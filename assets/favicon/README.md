# Favicon

This is really just a small favicon to have one.  
In case you want to get all favicons for all sizes and so use this link: [favicons.zip](https://github.com/rugk/threema-msgapi-webui/files/93403/favicons.zip)

These favicons are created with https://realfavicongenerator.net. To create the icons by yourself you can use their [API](https://realfavicongenerator.net/api/non_interactive_api#.Vpuc_FIxmUk). The [`rfg_request.json`](rfg_request.json) file (without an API key) is included in this repo.
